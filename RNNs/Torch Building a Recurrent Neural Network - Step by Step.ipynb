    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a uni-directional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirection RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",

    "Congratulations! You've successfully built the forward propagation of a recurrent neural network from scratch. This will work well enough for some applications, but it suffers from vanishing gradient problems. So it works best when each output $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ can be estimated using mainly \"local\" context (meaning information from inputs $x^{\\langle t' \\rangle}$ where $t'$ is not too far from $t$). \n",

    "This following figure shows the operations of an LSTM-cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/LSTM.png\" style=\"width:500;height:400px;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> **Figure 4**: LSTM-cell. This tracks and updates a \"cell state\" or memory variable $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ at every time-step, which can be different from $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$. </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the RNN example above, you will start by implementing the LSTM cell for a single time-step. Then you can iteratively call it from inside a for-loop to have it process an input with $T_x$ time-steps. \n",

    "### About the gates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Forget gate\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this illustration, lets assume we are reading words in a piece of text, and want use an LSTM to keep track of grammatical structures, such as whether the subject is singular or plural. If the subject changes from a singular word to a plural word, we need to find a way to get rid of our previously stored memory value of the singular/plural state. In an LSTM, the forget gate lets us do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_f[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_f)\\tag{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_f$ are weights that govern the forget gate's behavior. We concatenate $[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ and multiply by $W_f$. The equation above results in a vector $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with values between 0 and 1. This forget gate vector will be multiplied element-wise by the previous cell state $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. So if one of the values of $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is 0 (or close to 0) then it means that the LSTM should remove that piece of information (e.g. the singular subject) in the corresponding component of $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. If one of the values is 1, then it will keep the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Update gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we forget that the subject being discussed is singular, we need to find a way to update it to reflect that the new subject is now plural. Here is the formulat for the update gate: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_u[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\{t\\}}] + b_u)\\tag{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the forget gate, here $\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is again a vector of values between 0 and 1. This will be multiplied element-wise with $\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, in order to compute $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Updating the cell \n",
    "\n",
    "To update the new subject we need to create a new vector of numbers that we can add to our previous cell state. The equation we use is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_c[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_c)\\tag{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new cell state is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}* c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + \\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} *\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} \\tag{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Output gate\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which outputs we will use, we will use the following two formulas: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}=  \\sigma(W_o[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_o)\\tag{5}$$ \n",
    "$$ a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}* \\tanh(c^{\\langle t \\rangle})\\tag{6} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in equation 5 you decide what to output using a sigmoid function and in equation 6 you multiply that by the $\\tanh$ of the previous state. "
